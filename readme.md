## Process

Since the objective was to show web scraping, each data was retrive from different sources:

|Information Retrived|Source|
|:---:|:---:|
|Mars News|https://mars.nasa.gov/news/|
|Featured Image & image details|https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars|
|Mars Weather|https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en|
|General Facts|https://space-facts.com/mars/|
|Mars Hemispheres|https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars|

From this, a dictionary was created and uploaded into a MongoDB database through Python's Flask library so that when you open the site you'll see the latest scrape made.

## Data inside the repository

In this repository you'll see two app.py files, the one with the word 'simple' at the name, is the one used in the deployement of the [site](https://results-scrape-mars.herokuapp.com/) without the scraping function. Since this code was created using a chromedriver and it's not compatible with Heroku, I had to simplify the deployed site to only show the latest scrape rather than doing the scraping directly.
