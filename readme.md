## Process

Since the objective was to show web scraping, each data was retrive from different sources:

|Information Retrived|Source|
|:---:|:---:|
|Mars News|https://mars.nasa.gov/news/|
|Featured Image & image details|https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars|
|Mars Weather|https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en|
|General Facts|https://space-facts.com/mars/|
|Mars Hemispheres|https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars|

From this, a dictionary was created and uploaded into a MongoDB database through Python's Flask library so that when you open the site you'll see the latest scrape made.
